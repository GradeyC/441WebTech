This week's work was really not as bad as I thought it would be. I found it to be a really fun time working with three.js, and will likely work on it more over time. While not in this project. I was originally looking to use physics to create something interesting with realistic falling and motion. However that was a little intense for a single week. Overall I am really happy with how my project turned out, even though some of the things I was working with aren't perfect. The only real issue I ran into was figuring out controls for the model. I tried a few different types of controls and changing and fiddling with the trackball controls. But was never able to get it to work.
