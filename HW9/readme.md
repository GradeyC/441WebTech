This week was definitely much rougher for me than last week. While I found what we were doing very interesting, it was hard for me to put it together. I found myself often fiddling with small things, and it honestly was a little overwhelming at times. Leading me to get a bit demotivated at the time. Beyond that I feel like part of the issue is that I was having trouble for a while seeing what I was doing. While I used Firefox and chrome I was having a really hard time getting it to show as a webpage. I plan to work on this more over the week and try to improve my understand of the content. Both to improve this project as its own entity but also to help me be better prepared for what's to come.
