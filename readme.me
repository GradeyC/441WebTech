This week was not the most difficult when it came to execution. However it was one of the hardest 
weeks in terms of how I was able to wrap my head around things. I found that I got a bit confused, and it took a little while to understand all of the content. 
While my work still is not perfect as I am unsure why the image wont print. I do have a much better idea of how to use and create classes. I found myself feeling very satisfied when I was able to have everything change when the button was clicked.
