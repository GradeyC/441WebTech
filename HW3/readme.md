This week was somewhat rough for me. While I now have a much better understanding of the content, and how to work with JavaScript. I would be lying if I said it wasn't at least a little frustrating. This was mostly due to having my scope for the story itself being a bit too wide, wanting to make things intertwine way too much. But after I started having an understanding of what was going on, I was able to have it all mostly work.
