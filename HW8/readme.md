This weeks work was a bit easier for me to understand. While I ended up having issues primarily with things showing up and to some extent the complexity of what I was trying to do. I did enjoy this weeks work despite it being somewhat unfinished. I am glad that what did turn out looks good for what it is however and am looking forward to working on refining it in my personal time.
