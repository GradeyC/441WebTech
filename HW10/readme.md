This week was somewhat fun and not nearly as confusing as last week. I found that using HTML5 was fairly familiar. While I found myself having an easier time understanding this weeks content, I wish I had came up with something more interesting. Finding that I was having a hard time being really creative. This is not specific to this assignment, but am sad to see it impact it. While what I made was fairly basic, and not very complex. I hope that I can try and get over this creative lull im in by working on it more and adding to it over the week.
