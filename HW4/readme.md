Honestly this week was tough mostly due to myself redoing things in such large ways. While I somewhat easily understood what we were doing, I found myself to keep over complicating the assignment. Having stories with possibly 20 or more options, which became hard for me to keep track of. Eventually I settled on what you see now, but realize I need to use my time more efficiently and have a more controlled approach to my work. As to not give myself a time crunch and have to rush as opposed to giving it time and the effort it deserves.
