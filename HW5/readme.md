Honestly this week was rough mostly in how my program keeps bugging. While I did ask for help from some friends, I probably should have been more open to looking for help. As typically I would spend a lot of time looking and trying to bug fix, but getting so frustrated that it did more harm than good. This tended to lead me towards being a bit hard to work on the homework in general, leaving me dissatisfied with my work to some extent. I think that if I had reached out and likely given myself more time and flexibility to work and debug it would be a much more clean work.
