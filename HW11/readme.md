This weeks work was honestly a mix of ups and down. While I had a good understanding of what I was doing for the most part. I found myself a bit frustrated mostly due to spending most of my time debugging things. With most of the errors being logic errors and very tedious to fix. Outside of that I really enjoyed this weeks work, and helped me understand how all of the elements we've been using tie together. Im planning to do a little more work on this mostly to add a few functions that I didn't add as of now. With these being things such as a respawn timer for the collectables, a timer for how many things you can collect in a given time limit and an enemy to follow the player.
